<p id="first">For several generations, stories from Africa have traditionally<br>
been passed down by word of mouth. Often, after a hard day’s work, the<br>
adults would gather the children together by moonlight, around a village <br>
fire and tell stories. This was traditionally called 'Tales by Moonlight'.<br> 
Usually, the stories are meant to prepare young people for life, and so each<br>
story taught a lesson or moral. <br>
In the African folktales, the stories reflect the culture where diverse<br>
types of animals abound. The animals and birds are often accorded human attributes,<br>
so it is not uncommon to find animals talking, singing, or demonstrating other human<br>
characteristics such as greed, jealousy, honesty, etc. The setting in many of the stories<br> 
exposes the reader to the land form and climate within that region of Africa. References <br>
are often made to different seasons such as the 'dry' or 'rainy' season and their various <br>
effects on the surrounding vegetation and animal life.
